# Home-Price-Prediction-Linear-Regression
his repository contains a Linear Regression model built with scikit-learn to predict home prices based on features like area, number of bedrooms, and house age. The dataset (homeprices.csv) includes 6 samples, with one missing value in the bedrooms column, which was handled by imputing the median.
Key Features:

Data preprocessing to handle missing values using median imputation.
Linear regression implementation with scikit-learn.
Model coefficients and intercept analysis for interpretability.
Sample prediction for a custom input (2500 sq ft, 4 bedrooms, 5 years old).
Files:

homeprices.csv: Dataset with area, bedrooms, age, and price.
Home_price_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with the complete workflow.
Explore the code to see how linear regression can be applied to real-world prediction tasks! Contributions and feedback are welcome.
